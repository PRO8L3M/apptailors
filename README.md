# Apptailors

### Stuff to improve

- I assumed according to the mocks that player should be working in fullscreen, landscape mode. That's why I forced the landscape mode only. It would be the first thing to improve by me.
- Add animations
- Optimization of Exoplayer (To be honest, for the very first time I faced to Exoplayer. Research about it consumed a lot of time but still results in Kotlin about Exo are ridiculously small)
- I could use one big `<include>` as a Buff (right now I have mixed two approaches). Ofc it's one of the few possible solutions.
- I could use viewBinding but I don't like it too much due to its errors handling/error trace. It's very enigmatic.
- More precisely UI according to Mocks (lack of time).
